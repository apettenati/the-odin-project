This repo contains all the projects I completed while learning web development, primarily from The Odin Project

---

###### [Rock Paper Scissors- The Odin Project](https://apettenati.github.io/the-odin-project/rock-paper-scissors/game.html)
- First javascript project with minimal CSS

###### [Quiz Application from CS50 Beyond](https://apettenati.github.io/the-odin-project/quiz/quiz.html)
- Second javascript project with minimal CSS

###### [Flashcards from CS50 Beyond](https://apettenati.github.io/the-odin-project/flashcards/flashcards.html)
- First project with React

###### [Drum Kit from JavaScript 30](https://apettenati.github.io/the-odin-project/JS30/01.drum-kit/index.html)
- When completing this project, the original [source](https://javascript30.com/) (from 2016) references using 'keyCode' but I discovered this has since been [deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode). I replaced this with using [key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) and used the keyboard letters themselves rather than the key codes.

###### [Etch-A-Sketch](https://apettenati.github.io/the-odin-project/etch-a-sketch/index.html)
- Implemented first self-driven project based on The Odin Project requirements
- Used CSS grid to create the layout

###### [Calculator](https://apettenati.github.io/the-odin-project/calculator/index.html)
- Implemented with CSS Grid
