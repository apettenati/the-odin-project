This repo contains all the projects I completed while learning web development, primarily from The Odin Project

## JavaScript30

- [Drum Kit](https://apettenati.github.io/the-odin-project/JS30/01.drum-kit/index.html)
    - When completing this project, the original source (from 2016) references using 'keyCode' but I discovered this has since been [deprecated](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode). I replaced this with using [key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key) and used the keyboard letters themselves rather than the key codes.
